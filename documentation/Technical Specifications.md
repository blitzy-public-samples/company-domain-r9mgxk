The following programming languages have been selected for the development of the automated B2B lead generation and outreach solution:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Python | Backend services, data processing, web scraping | - Extensive libraries for web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)<br>- Strong support for data processing and NLP (pandas, NLTK)<br>- Easy integration with Google Cloud services<br>- Efficient for rapid development and prototyping |

| Go | Microservices (optional) | - High performance and concurrency support<br>- Efficient for building scalable microservices<br>- Good integration with Google Cloud Platform |

### DATABASE DESIGN

The system will utilize Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL document database, for its primary data storage. This choice aligns with the scalability requirements and the semi-structured nature of the data we'll be handling.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    COMPANY {
        string id
        string domain
        string name
        string description
        timestamp scrape_date
        object metadata
    }
    CEO {
        string id
        string name
        string linkedin_url
        string email
        string phone
        object metadata
    }
    LEAD {
        string id
        string status
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
        object company_ref
        object ceo_ref
        object metadata
    }
    EMAIL {
        string id
        string subject
        string body
        timestamp generated_at
        string status
        object lead_ref
        object campaign_ref
    }
    CAMPAIGN {
        string id
        string name
        timestamp start_date
        timestamp end_date
        array email_refs
        object metadata
    }
    COMPANY ||--o| CEO : has
    COMPANY ||--o{ LEAD : generates
    LEAD ||--o{ EMAIL : has
    EMAIL }o--|| CAMPAIGN : belongs_to
```

### API DESIGN

The system will expose a RESTful API for communication between different components and integration with external systems. The API will be built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework for building APIs.

#### API Endpoints

```

#### Sample React Component (TypeScript)

```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface LeadCardProps {
  id: string;
  companyName: string;
  ceoName: string;
  status: 'new' | 'contacted' | 'qualified' | 'converted';
}

const LeadCard: React.FC<LeadCardProps> = ({ id, companyName, ceoName, status }) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800">{companyName}</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">CEO: {ceoName}</p>
      <span className={`inline-block px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full ${
        status === 'new' ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800' :
        status === 'contacted' ? 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800' :
        status === 'qualified' ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800' :
        'bg-purple-100 text-purple-800'
      }`}>
        {status.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + status.slice(1)}
      </span>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LeadCard;
```

This system design section outlines the key technical decisions and structures for the automated B2B lead generation and outreach solution. It maintains consistency with the previously mentioned technologies, emphasizing the use of Python for backend services, React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Google Cloud Platform services for infrastructure and data storage.
